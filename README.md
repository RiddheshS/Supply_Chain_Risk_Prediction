# Supply_Chain_Risk_Prediction
Supply_Chain_Risk_Prediction uses machine learning to analyze data like demand, delivery times, supplier history, and global events. It finds patterns that signal possible delays or failures, then gives risk scores and alerts. This helps businesses act early by adjusting suppliers, inventory, or shipping routes to avoid disruption.
